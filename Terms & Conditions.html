            <li>Privacy Notice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional terms may also apply to certain Services, and are incorporated by reference herein as applicable. For example, if you register a domain name with us, then the Domain Registration Agreement will also apply to you and would be incorporated herein.</p>

        <ul>

        <p>Our Transfers Team will make every effort to help you move your website to us. We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or all account data. In some cases we may not be able to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. In no event shall HostingKZN be held liable for any lost or missing data or files resulting from a transfer to or from HostingKZN. You are solely responsible for backing up your data in all circumstances.</p>

        <p>Any malfunction or manufacturer's defects of Non-HostingKZN Products, either sold, licensed or provided by HostingKZN to you will not be deemed a breach of HostingKZN's obligations under this Agreement. Any rights or remedies you may have regarding the ownership, licensing, performance or compliance of any Non-HostingKZN Product are limited to those rights extended to you by the manufacturer of such Non-HostingKZN Product.

        <h2>Prohibited Persons (Countries, Entities, And Individuals)</h2>

The obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of the Services.</p>
        <h2>Account Security and HostingKZN Systems</h2>
        <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of the installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. You are required to use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password.</p>
        <p>The Services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided only for authorized customer use. HostingKZN may, but is not obligated to, monitor our systems, including without limitation, to ensure that use is authorized, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes. By using the Services, you consent to monitoring for these purposes.</p>
        <p>Any account found connecting to a third party network or system without authorization from the third party is subject to suspension. Access to networks or systems outside of your direct control requires the express written consent of the third party. HostingKZN may, at our discretion, request documentation to prove that your access to a third party network or system is authorized.</p>
        <p>Any account which causes us to receive an abuse report may be terminated and/or have access to services suspended. If you do not remove malicious content from your account after being notified by HostingKZN of an issue, we reserve the right to leave access to services disabled.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for any applicable compliance with South African or state laws governing the privacy and security of personal data, including medical or other sensitive data. You acknowledge that the Services may not be appropriate for the storage or control of access to sensitive data, such as information about children or medical or health information. HostingKZN does not control or monitor the information or data you store on, or transmit through, the Services. We do not sign "Business Associate Agreements" and you agree that HostingKZN is not a Business Associate or subcontractor or agent of yours. If you have questions about the security of your data, you should contact support@hostingkzn.com.</p>
        <h2>Compatibility with the Services</h2>
        <p>You agree to cooperate fully with HostingKZN in connection with HostingKZN's provision of the Services. It is solely your responsibility to provide any equipment or software that may be necessary for your use of the Services. To the extent that the performance of any of our obligations under this Agreement may depend upon your performance of your obligations, HostingKZN is not responsible for any delays due to your failure to timely perform your obligations.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that all User Content and User Websites are compatible with the hardware and software used by HostingKZN to provide the Services, which may be changed by HostingKZN from time to time in our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for backing-up all User Content, including but not limited to, any User Websites. HostingKZN does not warrant that we back-up any User Content, and you agree to accept the risk of loss of any and all User Content.</p>
        <h2>Email Policy</h2>
        <h3>Limits</h3>
        <p>There is a 500 outgoing email hourly limit per domain. This limit is also applied towards Mailman. If you send over this amount in any hour, most of the e-mails will bounce back with an undeliverable error. If this occurs, it will then take some time for your account to be able to send again so we recommend waiting at least 1 hour after this issue occurs to begin sending email again.</p>
        <p>Many of our servers have a limit of 30 POP3/IMAP checks per hour per each user's connecting IP address. If you go over this you're likely to get a wrong password error message or an error stating "login incorrect". If this occurs, please wait an hour and it will automatically unblock you. To prevent this from happening again, please make sure to disable auto checking or at least set it to something higher such as once every 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Any mailing list larger than 5,000 addresses will require a dedicated server or VPS hosting solution from us. Note: Dividing one large list into smaller lists to get below this limit is not allowed.</p>
        <p>There is also a limit to the number of Mailman mailing lists permitted as follows (NOTE: This does not apply to other mailing list programs such as PHPList. This only applies to Mailman.)</p>
        <h3>Mailing Lists Rules</h3>
        <p>Any time you're sending a message no matter how large your e-mail list is you must throttle it. We recommend you throttle it to at the very least sending 1 email every 8 seconds. (Sending 1 every 8 seconds would send 450 emails within 1 hour, keeping you below the 500 outgoing email limit.) If the mailing list software you're using does not allow you to throttle you must switch to an application or script that will. We recommend PHPList, which can be found in your CPanel, under Quickinstall.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: If you do not throttle and you try sending 500 emails, the server will try sending all 500 in 1 second which is not possible on our shared servers. This will cause a very high load on the server and the entire server will be sluggish, potentially affecting your sites and service, until this sending process is completed. It is our job to keep the server up and running without being sluggish or experiencing issues. Anyone who causes the server's load to go high will be suspended and the process will be terminated. If you choose not to throttle, you will most likely be suspended for crashing the server.</p>
        <p>The list must be a Double Opt-In list. This means a user has subscribed for a newsletter or other email marketing messages by explicitly requesting it and confirming the email address to be their own. Confirmation is usually done by responding to a notification/confirmation email sent to the email address the end user specified. The double opt-in method eliminates the chance of abuse where somebody submits someone else's email address without their knowledge and against their will. You will not be permitted to mail any mailing list that you were given or purchased. In doing so, this will also be considered spamming and may result in termination of the offending account.</p>
        <p>Email Scripts must be able to handle and document all information from a double opt-in list. This includes recording the sign-up IP address and date/time, double opt-in verification IP address and date/time, processing opt-outs (via web or email), and list removal on bounce backs. All opt-outs or bounce back removals must be handled in a timely manner, and outbound mail must be throttled on shared packages to a maximum of five hundred (500) emails per hour. If your account is found to be using a script that does not meet these requirements, HostingKZN reserves the right to suspend, terminate, or deactivate your script or account.</p>
        <p>Any unsolicited e-mail being sent will result in suspension or termination of the offending account. We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail and other forms of spam.</p>
        <p>No direct SMTP mailers are allowed. An example of this would be a Darkmailer or The Bat!. Any mail should be sent through the local mail server/MTA for further delivery by the server and not done directly by scripts.</p>
        <h2>Billing and Payment Information</h2>
        <h3>Prepayment</h3>
        <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. You agree to pay for the Services in advance of the time period during which such Services are provided. Subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations, payments received will be first applied to the oldest outstanding invoice in your billing account.</p>
        <h3>Auto-renewal</h3>
        <p>Unless otherwise provided, you agree that until and unless you notify HostingKZN of your desire to cancel the Services, you will be billed on an automatically recurring basis to prevent any disruption to your Services, using your credit card or other billing information on file with us.</p>
        <h3>Late Payment</h3>
        <p>All invoices must be paid within seven (7) days of the invoice due date. Any invoice that is outstanding for more than seven (7) days may result in the suspension or termination of Services. Access to the account will not be restored until payment has been received. If you fail to pay the fees as specified herein, HostingKZN may suspend or terminate your account and pursue the collection costs incurred by HostingKZN, including without limitation, any arbitration and legal fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees. HostingKZN will not activate new orders or activate new packages for customers who have an outstanding balance on their account.</p>
        <h3>Domain Payments</h3>
        <p>Domain renewal notices are provided as a courtesy reminder and HostingKZN is not responsible for a failure to renew a domain or a failure to notify a customer about a domain's renewal. Domain renewals are billed and renewed fifteen (15) days before the renew date.</p>
        <h3>Fraud</h3>
        <p>It is a violation of this Agreement for you to misuse or fraudulently use credit cards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers, electronic checks, or any other payment method. HostingKZN may report any such misuse or fraudulent use, as determined in HostingKZN's sole discretion, to governmental and law enforcement authorities, credit reporting services, financial institutions and/or credit card companies.</p>
        <h3>Invoice Disputes</h3>
        <p>You have thirty (30) days to dispute any charge or payment processed by HostingKZN. If you have any questions concerning a charge on your account, please reach out to our billing department for assistance.</p>
        <h3>Payment Card Industry Security Standard Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>HostingKZN complies with the Payment Card Industry Security Standard ("PCI Standard") in connection with the collection and processing of our customer's data and billing information. However, you are solely responsible for the security of the data and billing information on your User Website. HostingKZN does not monitor User Websites for PCI compliance and we are not able to verify whether a User Website complies with the PCI Standard.</p>
        <h2>Cancellations</h2>
        <p>A thirty (30) day cancellation notice via email from the registered email account and owner of the account is required to effect cancellation. Once we receive your cancellation form and have confirmed all necessary information with you via email, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been cancelled.</p>
        <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Refund eligibility will be handled on a case for case basis and at HostingKZN’s sole discretion.</p>
        <h2>Non-refundable Products and Services</h2>
