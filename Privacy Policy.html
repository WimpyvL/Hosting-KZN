            <li>Payment information, including debit or credit card data that you provide to us (by way of our Services or otherwise) when you purchase some of our products and services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We use the information we collect, both on its own and combined with any other information we collect about you, for the following business and commercial purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the requested Services to you;</li>

        <h2>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We do not share any information obtained as set out above unless it is for legal reasons or by South African Law.</p>
    
        <h2>SHARING WITH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third parties to assist us in servicing you (for example, providing you with customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to advertising assets and providing us with information technology and storage services) or to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities (including providing us with analytic information and search engine optimization services). Additional information about certain third-party service providers we share personal information with is available <a href="#">here</a>. Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.</p>
        <p>If you purchase a product or service from a third party through one of our brands, we will pass your personal information to such third party in order for them to fulfil your order.</p>
        <p>We offer features that allow you to better target who you contact through our products and services. These features allow you to optimize your campaigns, segment your lists, and better customize your offerings to your customers. In order to do this, we partner with third parties who can provide you with information about your contacts. These third parties are prohibited from using this personal data for any purpose beyond that for which it was shared.</p>
    
        <h2>CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS</h2>
        <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or other similar sale transaction, your information will be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transfer and any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>
    
        <h2>LEGAL PROCESS</h2>
        <p>If legally required to do so, or if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, we may disclose your personal information to courts of law, public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), and other relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, to conduct an investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or court order, to bring legal action, prevent harm to others or pursue other relief when you or a third party are or may be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violating our terms and conditions of use;</li>
            <li>Causing injury or other harm to, or otherwise violating the property or other legal rights, of us, other users, or third parties or violating state, local, or other applicable law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties in connection with a subpoena.</p>
    
        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>The transmission of information via the internet, email or text message is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted through the Services or over email; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, unauthorized use, access or modification.</p>
    
        <h2>CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h2>
        <h3>MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS FROM US</h3>
        <h4>EMAIL</h4>
        <p>You always have the opportunity to opt out of our marketing communications with you or change your preferences by following a link in the footer of all non-transactional email messages from us or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@hostingkzn.com">support@hostingkzn.com</a>. Some communications from us are considered transactional or service communications (for example, important account notifications and billing information). You agree to receive these transactional and service communications as a condition of the Services that we provide to you. You must cancel your accounts for all Services, if you do not wish to receive any transactional or service communications from us. To cancel your account, please follow the instructions found in the terms of service for the applicable Service. You may still receive marketing communications from us even after you cancel your account unless you also opt-out of our marketing communications, as described above.</p>
        <h4>PHONE</h4>
        <p>If you do not want to receive marketing calls by phone, you may contact customer support at the brand from which you purchased your Services and indicate your preference to us.</p>
    
        <h2>COOKIES</h2>
        <p>For information about how to manage and opt out from cookies, please visit our <a href="#">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>
    
        <h2>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information to provide services to you and as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We will retain your personal information for no more than seven years following the later of the date on which you terminate your use of the Services, unless we are otherwise required by law or regulation to retain your personal information for longer.</p>
    
        <h2>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Depending on what information we collect from you and how we collect it, we rely on various grounds for processing your information under the GDPR, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In order to administer our contractual relationship, including setting up your requested Services, payments, renewals and processes;</li>
            <li>Because it is in our legitimate interest to run a successful and efficient business and provide you with the Services and other useful content;</li>
            <li>In order to fulfil any legal obligations we may have to collect this information from you; and/or</li>
            <li>Because you have provided your consent for us to do so.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>YOUR RIGHT TO CONTROL HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED</h2>
        <p>You have the right to make requests regarding your personal information. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask us to update or correct personal information if it is inaccurate;</li>
            <li>Request that we transfer some or all of your personal information to you or a third party (whenever it is technically feasible to do so);</li>
            <li>Make choices about receiving marketing communications;</li>
            <li>Withdraw your consent to process your personal information in circumstances where we are relying on your consent as our basis for processing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of your rights, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@hostingkzn.com">support@hostingkzn.com</a>.</p>
        <p>We will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights.</p>
    
        <h2>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY OUR USERS</h2>
        <p>Some of our Services provide links to other websites. Because we do not control the information policies or practices of these third party sites, you should review their privacy policies to learn about how they collect and use personal information.</p>
    
        <h2>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy notice at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change this privacy notice in any material way, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on <a href="https://www.hostingkzn.com">www.hostingkzn.com</a> or the product or service you use prior to the change becoming effective. In all cases, your continued use of any Services constitutes acceptance to any such changes.</p>
